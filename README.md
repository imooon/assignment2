## Description

#### This website showcases my professional portfolio which will be updated with more experience and projects as time passes by.

## User Story

#### Potential employers want to view a deployed portfolio of work samples in order to review and assess if a potenial employee is a good candidate for a position.  

## Acceptance Criteria

#### A number of changes have been made to the codebase to meet the criteria:

#### 1. Availability of a current photo of the employee along with their name. 
#### 2. Creation of three main sections: About Me, My Projects and Contact Me (clicking links guides the user to the specific section). 
#### 3. Hovering on the projects makes the specific project larger.
